        <p>Revenge of the Sith shows the fall of Anakin Skywalker as he turns to the dark side. Anakin becomes more conflicted over his fear of losing Padme, which he sees dying in childbirth. Chancellor Palpatine manipulates Anakin, convincing him that the dark side can save her. Anakin ultimately turns against the Jedi, becoming Darth Vader, and helps the Emperor wipe out most of the Jedi Order. Padme, devastated by Anakin's betrayal, dies after giving birth to twins, Luke and Leia. The galaxy falls under the Empireâ€™s control, marking the rise of Darth Vader and the beginning of a new era.</p>
